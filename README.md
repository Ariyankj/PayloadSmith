# PayloadSmith

**PayloadSmith** is a Python-based tool designed to help penetration testers easily find bypass payloads for different web application testing scenarios.
## Project Overview

As penetration testers, we often run into applications that seem secure, but we know there's a flaw that can be exploited. However, remembering a working bypass payload for every situation can be challenging. That's why i created PayloadSmith. It provides a repository of bypass payloads and suggests the right one for given scenario .

### Features

- **Python-based**: Built with Python for easy customization and flexibility.
- **Open Source**: Completely free and open-source for the community.
